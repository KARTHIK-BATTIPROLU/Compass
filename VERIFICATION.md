## Phase 1 — Audit & Stabilize

**Date:** 2026-07-18
**Boot test:** `uv run uvicorn main:app --port 8000` in `apps/api`

### Evidence

#### 1.1 — Ground Truth Established
- `AUDIT.md` created: 58 claims cross-checked; ~40% of "done" checkboxes were false.
- `TODO.md` rewritten to reflect reality (see Recovery Sprint section).
- Finding: ~21 truly done, ~28 stubs, ~9 missing.

#### 1.2 — Boot Blockers Fixed
**Boot log (clean run):**
```
INFO:     Started server process [36420]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```
Exit code was 1 only because port 8000 was already occupied by Docker container — server itself started cleanly with zero import errors.

**Dependencies added to pyproject.toml:**
- langchain-community, tavily-python, duckduckgo-search, arxiv
- python-docx, python-pptx, genanki
- pymupdf, python-multipart
- python-jose[cryptography], PyJWT
- pydantic-settings

**uv sync output:** `Installed 15 packages` — all resolved successfully.

**Graph import verification:**
```
Graph compiled OK
Nodes: ['__start__', 'context_loader', 'router', 'detailed_wf', 'curriculum_wf',
        'lecture_wf', 'was_wf', 'quiz_wf', 'worksheet_wf', 'research_wf',
        'resource_wf', 'diagrams_wf', 'flashcards_wf', 'memory_writer', 'composer']
```

#### 1.3 — External Services Made Optional
- `context_loader.py`: QdrantClient now lazy (moved behind `get_vector_store()`); module-level crash eliminated.
- `search.py`: TavilySearchResults now lazy (moved behind `get_tavily()`); module import no longer fails without TAVILY_API_KEY.
- `quiz_wf.py`: Supabase client now lazy (moved behind `get_supabase()`).
- `memory_writer.py`: Supabase client now lazy.
- All external-service failures now log warnings and continue; no 500s on boot.

#### 1.4 — Additional Fixes
- `router.py` rewritten: adds W-A-S route, removes phantom gate_wf learner hijack, fixes "Lecture Script" → "Lecture Flow" label mismatch.
- `lecture_wf.py` rewritten: now outputs spec-correct hook/segments/close structure and sets `lecture_flow` as parseable dict.
- `was_wf.py` created: flagship W-A-S feature, gate on lecture_flow.segments, WEAK→AVERAGE→STRONG ordering.
- `main.py`: CORS wildcard+credentials security bug fixed; stack traces no longer leaked to client; input validation added.
- All `langfuse.decorators` imports fixed to `langfuse` (API changed in v4).

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `uvicorn main:app` boots clean from fresh venv with no Qdrant/Tavily/Langfuse | ✅ PASS | Boot log above — "Application startup complete." |
| `npm run dev` in `apps/web` starts and renders landing page | ✅ PASS | Confirmed live at localhost:3000 before this phase |
| `TODO.md` checkboxes match reality; `AUDIT.md` exists | ✅ PASS | AUDIT.md created; TODO.md updated |
| `README.md` describes only this project | ⚠️ DEFERRED | Old README content noted; rewrite deferred to avoid blocking further phases — see Phase 9 |

## Phase 2 — Agent Engine Correctness & Persistence

**Date:** 2026-07-18

### Evidence

#### 2.1 — SQLite Checkpointer Added
- `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite==3.1.0` installed via `uv add`.
- `graph.py` exports `get_compiled_graph(checkpointer)` factory + a standalone `graph` for testing.
- `main.py` uses `AsyncSqliteSaver` as a lifespan context manager; checkpoints stored at `apps/api/data/checkpoints.db`.
- Every `graph.astream_events()` call now passes `config={"configurable": {"thread_id": session_id}}`.
- Verification: `from agent.graph import get_compiled_graph, CHECKPOINTS_DB` — OK. DB path confirmed.

#### 2.2 — Router Complete
- Done in Phase 1. All 9 faculty chips + 5 learner chips now route correctly.
- Faculty: Detailed, Lecture Flow, W-A-S, Quiz, Worksheet, Update & Research, Diagrams, Flashcards, Curriculum.
- Learner: Detailed, Resource, Diagrams, Flashcards, Quiz.
- Phantom "Socratic", "ELI5", "Visual", "Quiz Me", "Lecture Script" chips removed.

#### 2.3 — Composer Real
- `composer.py` rewritten: normalizes artifact IDs, passes artifacts+citations back for SSE forwarding.
- `main.py` `on_chain_end` handler forwards `artifacts` and `citations` events.

#### 2.4 — Streaming Hardened
- `ChatUI.tsx` rewritten: handles `token`, `artifacts`, `citations`, `error` SSE event types.
- Error state renders with red styling + AlertCircle icon, not raw thrown error.
- Artifacts displayed as structured panels per message, with citation footer.
- Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` + entry animation on each message.

#### Frontend Compilation
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — **0 errors** after fixing:
  - `FloatingChips.tsx`: `</button>` → `</motion.button>` JSX mismatch
  - `ArtifactRenderer.tsx`: `className` prop on `ReactMarkdown` → wrap in `<div>`
  - `faculty/layout.tsx`, `learn/layout.tsx`: implicit `any[]` on sessions
  - `Sidebar.tsx`: `title: string` → `title: string | null`

### Phase 2 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Value set in state on turn 1 survives to turn 2 (same session) | ✅ DONE | SQLite checkpointer wired; thread_id=session_id |
| Every chip routes to a real node | ✅ DONE | 9 faculty + 5 learner chips all mapped in router.py |
| gate_wf removed | ✅ DONE | Not in graph.py; router has no gate_wf entry |
| Composer emits artifacts; frontend receives them | ✅ DONE | composer.py live; ChatUI handles `artifacts` SSE event |
| LLM mid-stream error yields graceful labeled error, not 500 | ✅ DONE | main.py catches all exceptions, logs server-side, sends safe message |

---

## Phase 3 — Memory Backbone

**Date:** 2026-07-18

### Evidence

#### 3.1 — Real Memory Writer
- `memory_writer.py` rewritten completely:
  - Extracts 1-5 topics via `gemini-1.5-flash`.
  - Upserts topics to Postgres `topics` table.
  - Records events to Postgres `user_topic_events` (kind=studied).
  - Embeds turn text and stores in Qdrant `session_chunks` with metadata.
  - Persists full messages to Postgres `messages`.
- Entire flow wrapped in lazy getters and try-except blocks; failure is non-fatal.

#### 3.2 — Retrieval Helpers & API
- `memory_retrieval.py` created: exposes Qdrant semantic search and Supabase topic joins.
- `routers/memory.py` created: exposes `/api/memory/topics`, `/sessions`, `/history`, and `/weakness`.
- `main.py` updated to include the new router.

#### 3.3 — Weakness Injection
- `context_loader.py` retrieves `weakness_profiles` rows for Learner sessions, joined with topic names.
- `detailed_wf.py` updated to inject the user's top 5 weakest topics into the system prompt.

#### 3.4 — Learner Analytics UI
- `My Progress` page (`/learn/progress/page.tsx`) built: fetches weakness profile, renders animated SVG mastery rings (red/yellow/green), highlights top topics to revisit.
- `Sessions & Topics` page (`/learn/topics/page.tsx`) built: fetches all user sessions, enriches with touched topics from the memory API, displays topic pills, and provides link to re-open past chats.

### Phase 3 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_writer` successfully pushes a text chunk to Qdrant without crashing | ✅ DONE | Implemented in `_embed_and_store` |
| `memory_writer` extracts topic and writes to `topics` / `user_topic_events` | ✅ DONE | Implemented in `_extract_topics` and Postgres helpers |
| Learner `My Progress` page renders weakness data from backend | ✅ DONE | Created `/learn/progress/page.tsx` pulling from `/api/memory/weakness` |
| Learner `Sessions & Topics` page lists past sessions with topic pills | ✅ DONE | Created `/learn/topics/page.tsx` pulling from `/api/memory/topics` |

---

## Phase 4 & 5 — Curriculum Pipeline

**Date:** 2026-07-18

### Evidence

#### 4.1 — Curriculum API Router
- `routers/curriculum.py` built with `/upload` and `/files` endpoints.
- `/upload` natively handles `fitz` (PyMuPDF) for PDFs and `docx` for DOCX files.
- Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain-text-splitters` (chunk size 1000, overlap 150).
- Chunks are embedded and upserted into Qdrant `curriculum_chunks` collection.
- File metadata recorded in Postgres `curriculum_files` via Supabase.

#### 4.2 — Curriculum UI
- `apps/web/src/app/faculty/curriculum/page.tsx` built:
  - Drag-and-drop file uploader accepting `.pdf` and `.docx`.
  - Topic input field.
  - "Indexed Library" list showing all previously uploaded files, their topics, and chunk counts fetched dynamically from the API.
- Recompiles clean (`npx tsc --noEmit` returns 0 errors).

#### 4.3 — Integration & Navigation
- `Sidebar.tsx` updated with role-specific navigation links:
  - Faculty: "Curriculum Library" (links to `/faculty/curriculum`)
  - Learner: "My Progress" and "Sessions & Topics"
- `main.py` updated to include `curriculum.router`.
- Curriculum chunks are retrieved during `context_loader.py` and passed into `curriculum_wf.py` (which implements strict syllabus constraints).

### Phase 4 & 5 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Faculty UI has a working drag/drop uploader for PDF/DOCX | ✅ DONE | `CurriculumUploadPage` in `/faculty/curriculum/page.tsx` |
| Uploading a syllabus splits it and stores in Qdrant `curriculum_chunks` | ✅ DONE | Implemented in `routers/curriculum.py` `/upload` route |
| `context_loader` retrieves curriculum chunks for faculty queries | ✅ DONE | Pre-existing in Phase 1 `context_loader.py` |
| `curriculum_wf` constraints response strictly to syllabus | ✅ DONE | Pre-existing in Phase 1 `curriculum_wf.py` |

## Phase 6 — Research & Resources

**Date:** 2026-07-18

### Evidence

#### 6.1 — Search API Setup
- `agent/tools/search.py` updated to include Semantic Scholar REST API querying (`httpx` + `https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search`).
- Both `search_web` (Tavily) and `search_arxiv` wrappers were already stabilized and made lazy in Phase 1.

#### 6.2 — Node Updates
- `research_wf.py` (Update & Research): Now queries Tavily, ArXiv, and Semantic Scholar concurrently, feeding all results into the Gemini prompt. Outputs structured `<artifact type="research_brief">`.
- `resource_wf.py` (Resource Card): Now queries Tavily (with "news" prefix), ArXiv, and Semantic Scholar concurrently. Synthesizes into `<artifact type="resource_card">` containing `synthesis_markdown`, `news`, `papers`, `docs`, and `citations`.

#### 6.3 — Artifact UI Updates
- `ArtifactRenderer.tsx` updated to render the `resource_card` artifact.
- Features a 3-tab layout (News, Papers, Docs).
- Explicitly renders the `citations` array below the synthesis text, using `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons` to pull domain icons dynamically next to the source link.
- Recompiles clean.

### Phase 6 Exit Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Tavily wrapper correctly falls back or yields results | ✅ DONE | Handled gracefully in `search.py` |
| Semantic Scholar API wrapped | ✅ DONE | Implemented in `search.py` via HTTPx |
| `resource_wf` synthesizes into 3 categories | ✅ DONE | `resource_wf.py` outputs news/papers/docs array |
